# Session Update: 2023-05-15

## Development Steps

1. `components/emoji-grid.tsx`: Updated EmojiGrid component
   - Implemented 10-second refresh interval for fetching new emojis
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Implemented like and download functionality for emojis
   - Added image retry loading mechanism with multiple attempts
   - Implemented tooltip for emoji prompts

2. `app/page.tsx`: Modified Home component
   - Implemented server-side rendering for initial emoji fetch
   - Added state management for emojis
   - Integrated EmojiGenerator and EmojiGrid components
   - Added Suspense wrapper for EmojiData component
   - Implemented checkEmojiStatus function for individual emoji status checks

3. `components/emoji-generator.tsx`: Created EmojiGenerator component
   - Implemented form for emoji generation
   - Added immediate display of generated emoji
   - Integrated with API for emoji generation
   - Implemented error handling and loading states

4. `app/api/generate-emoji/route.ts`: Implemented API route for emoji generation
   - Integrated with Replicate API for emoji generation
   - Implemented image upload to Supabase storage
   - Added new emoji to the database

## Key Decisions

- Chose to display generated emoji immediately in EmojiGenerator component for instant feedback
- Implemented server-side rendering for initial emoji fetch to improve performance and SEO
- Decided to use a 10-second interval for refreshing the emoji grid to balance responsiveness and server load
- Implemented a retry mechanism for loading images to handle potential delays in image availability
- Used tooltips for displaying full emoji prompts to improve UI/UX

## Next Steps

1. Implement user authentication system using Clerk
   - Integrate Clerk into the application
   - Create protected routes for authenticated users
   - Update API routes to handle authenticated requests

2. Create user profile page with generated emojis history
   - Design and implement a user profile component
   - Fetch and display user-specific emoji history
   - Add functionality to manage user's generated emojis

3. Implement pagination or infinite scroll for the emoji grid
   - Modify the EmojiGrid component to support loading more emojis
   - Update the API to support pagination or cursor-based fetching
   - Implement UI for loading more emojis (e.g., "Load More" button or infinite scroll)

4. Add error boundaries and improve error handling throughout the application
   - Implement React Error Boundaries for graceful error handling
   - Improve error messages and error state UI in components
   - Implement consistent error logging and reporting

5. Implement rate limiting for emoji generation to prevent abuse
   - Add rate limiting middleware to the generate-emoji API route
   - Implement user-specific rate limiting based on authentication
   - Add UI feedback for rate limiting (e.g., cooldown timer, remaining generations)

Progress: Completed core functionality of emoji generation and display. The application now supports generating emojis, displaying them in a grid, liking, and downloading. Next session will focus on user authentication and profile implementation, as well as improving the overall user experience with pagination and better error handling.
